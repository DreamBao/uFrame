# uFrame
Full uFrame has now been completely open sourced.  Use uFrame Architect, and ECS to build awesome games/apps or create your own uFrame spinned framework, the choice is up to you.

## MVVM Users
The current version of MVVM needs to be ported to the 2.0 engine.   ECS is what spawned the 2.0 engine and broke away from some backwards compatability issues that was hindering the engine from growing to what we wanted the product to eventually be.  If you are interested in assisting the port of the uFrame MVVM framework into uFrame ECS you are welcome to do so, but I would highly recommend that you just extend ECS with some MVVM type features.  

## Things to do
Documentation, Documentation, Documentation... This is completely key, and especially the internal editor stuff and using architect.
Port MVVM? or Extend ECS? the choose is yours.
